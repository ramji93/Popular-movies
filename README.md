# Popular-movies
my first android application.
Popularmovies android application will generate list of movie posters arranged in a grid view.
The list can be sorted through settings options where user can either select 'sort by popularity' or 'sort by review'.
On clicking a movie poster description activity will be launched which will show the description of the movie selected such
as cast, genre, synopsis, release date and average rating. All these informations and movie posters are fetched from
themoviedb api.
